# samples/flixel

This sample demonstrates the use of Polymod with the Flixel framework.
It includes several sprites and text files, and demonstrates file loading using the SysFileSystem, which loads files from folders on the local file system. It does not support ZIP files, use a different file system for that.

## Build Instructions

1. Install Haxe.
2. `haxelib install hmm` to download the dependency manager.
3. `haxelib run hmm install` to download dependencies.
4. `lime build windows -debug` to build the sample for Windows.
